TrustFund - a Stellar DAPP (Decentralized Application) that holds funded organisations to their promised goals. 

Facilitating easy, immutable **objective-based** funding with **no BS**. 




### What is TrustFund? 

In recent years, numerous scandals have highlighted the lack of transparency in charitable and crowdfunded organizations - funds are often mismanaged or misappropriated. 

TrustFund aims to solve this problem through  real-time transparency, third-party oversight, and smart contract-based governance to ensure that donated funds are used exclusively for their intended purposes.

The key mechanism - **returning of user funds** in the event objective criteria aren't met.

### The Mechanics behind TrustFund:

- **Direct donations.** Donors send money directly to a smart contract, ensuring no third-party involvement.

- **Authenticators.** Each project is assigned a group of authenticators—members who are stakeholders in the cause (e.g., environmentalists for a conservation fund).

- **Progress Monitoring.** Authenticators report on the organization’s progress toward predefined goals.

- **Conditional Funding.** Funds are only released once the authenticators confirm that all objectives have been fully met by the deadline.

- **Refunds.** If the goals are not achieved by the deadline, the smart contract automatically returns the money to the donors.

- **Authenticator Review.** Organizations can request a review if they believe an authenticator has unfairly rejected their progress.

### TrustFund’s Vision
TrustFund envisions a future where donors can confidently contribute to organizations, knowing their money will only be released if the objectives are met. By reducing the risks of fraud and mismanagement, TrustFund aims to:

Build trust between the public and charitable organizations.
Increase overall donations due to enhanced transparency and accountability.
Foster efficient goal completion by requiring organizations to meet milestones before receiving funds.
Provide a positive feedback loop that encourages charities to consistently reach their goals, leading to more successful projects and greater global impact.
